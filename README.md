# ISS-tracker

**Final Project Proposal**
Partner: Ben Wu
We will distribute work evenly 50/50 and help each other with tasks if needed.

Project Overview: We will create a bot that tracks the position of the International Space Station and map it out on a world map. The position will be tracked in real time in terms of longitude and latitude and show how far it is from your current location. The speed and direction of the ISS can also be recorded. Furthermore, the significance of the position will be displayed, such as which ocean/continent it is over, and if it is near any landmarks (e.g. Great Wall, Eiffel Tower, etc.)â€™

**Project Class and Methods**
Class: Location 
Method 1: Extract longitude and latitude
Method 2: Compare it to your position and find exact distance
Method 3: Check how far it is from list of defined landmark positions (TBD)

Class: Movement
Method 1: Find magnitude of velocity and acceleration
Method 2: Determine direction

Class: Display
Method 1: Initialize data from other 2 classes
Method 2: Display movement on world map/graph (TBD)


**Libraries**
Turtle Library: Creates Designs and Images
Urllib3 Library: Fetches URLs
Pycopy-webbrowser: Allows users to view Web-based documents

**Priority of Features**
High Priority: Longitude Latitude and display on some sort of map/graph
Medium Priority: Speed/acceleration and distance from you
Low Priority: Distance from landmarks
